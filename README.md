# nix-grpc-store

**Status: Stable.**

Remote Nix store access over gRPC instead of SSH. `nix copy` over a WAN
link is **5.5x faster than `ssh-ng://`** because round trips are hidden:
path-info queries are batched and NAR downloads are pipelined, so wall time
is bandwidth-bound instead of latency-bound.

Why gRPC instead of `ssh-ng://`?

  * **Latency-tolerant `nix copy`.** One RPC batches the path queries
    for a whole closure and one request per connection downloads all
    NARs as a server-driven stream. Copying 200 small paths at 50 ms
    RTT takes 1.3 s instead of the 11.8 s a round-trip-per-path client
    needs.
  * **Faster handshakes.** A TLS handshake is much cheaper than an SSH
    connection setup (no subprocess, no shell, no SSH key exchange and
    session negotiation), and connections are multiplexed over HTTP/2, so
    frequent short-lived store operations start quickly.
  * **Standard TLS certificates.** Authentication uses plain X.509 certs
    instead of SSH keys, so you can plug into existing PKI — for example a
    [step-ca](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/) issuing short-lived client
    and server certs — and reuse load balancers, service meshes and mTLS
    policies that already speak HTTP/2.
  * **Compression.** All traffic is zstd-compressed. A whole batch of
    paths shares a single zstd stream (one compression window across all
    NARs), unlike ssh's optional zlib, which made the benchmark below
    slower instead of faster.
  * **Scales to a build farm.** Point `builders =` or `--store` at one
    `grpc://` address and the daemons behind it spread the derivations
    over all nodes, like Hydra's queue runner but for any Nix client and
    without a database. See [docs/farm.md](docs/farm.md).

Everything that works over `ssh-ng://` works here: remote builds,
`nix copy`, path queries, GC. The gRPC layer is a thin tunnel to the
`nix-daemon` on the other side, with dedicated RPCs for the `nix copy` hot
path (path info queries, bulk import, NAR download).
[docs/latency.md](docs/latency.md) shows the round trips each
operation costs as sequence diagrams.

## Benchmark

### `nix copy`

![nix copy transport comparison](docs/bench.png)

`nix copy` of a 101-path, 411 MB closure from the same server over a
wired link with ~47 ms RTT, 10 interleaved runs each.

A static HTTP binary cache stays ahead for pure downloads, but it is
download-only. The gRPC store keeps close while also handling uploads,
remote builds, GC and mTLS through the same endpoint.

Reproduce with `./scripts/bench-transports.py`.

### Remote builds

There are two ways to build on a remote machine:

- **hook**: the machine is listed in `builders =`. For every
  derivation Nix spawns a fresh `build-remote` helper process that
  opens its own connections, uploads the inputs, runs the build and
  downloads the outputs.
- **direct**: the remote store is the target of the build
  (`nix build --store 'grpc://…'`). One client process drives the
  whole build graph over a single long-lived connection and outputs
  stay on the remote store.

On a chain of tiny builds over a ~50 ms WAN link, grpc is 1.4x faster
than `ssh-ng://` in hook mode: one streaming RPC submits a derivation
and returns the result with its output path infos, where ssh-ng pays
per-derivation ssh session setup. In direct mode the transports are
comparable, since a single long-lived connection serves the whole
build either way:

Reproduce with `./scripts/bench-builds.py`.

## Install

    nix build

This produces `result/bin/nix-grpc-daemon` for the server and
`result/lib/nix/plugins/nix-grpc-store-loader.so` for the client, which
dispatches to the plugin build matching the running Nix version.

For a client outside NixOS, `nix build .#nix-with-plugin` gives a `nix`
(and `nix-build`, `nix-store`, …) with the plugin already loaded. In
another flake, `nix-grpc-store.lib.wrapNix pkgs pkgs.nix` does the same
for any nixpkgs `nix`, for example to put into a CI image.

## Quick start (NixOS)

Add the flake and enable the modules:

    # flake.nix inputs
    nix-grpc-store.url = "github:Mic92/nix-grpc-store";

    # server
    imports = [ nix-grpc-store.nixosModules.server ];
    services.nix-grpc-daemon.enable = true;
    services.nix-grpc-daemon.tls = { certFile = ./server.pem; keyFile = ./server.key; };

    # client
    imports = [ nix-grpc-store.nixosModules.client ];
    programs.nix-grpc-store.enable = true;

The client module ships plugin builds for the supported Nix versions and a
loader that picks the one matching the running Nix. The server module runs
the daemon as an unprivileged `nix-grpc-daemon` user and adds it to
`extra-allowed-users` so it can reach the local `nix-daemon` even when
`allowed-users` is restricted.

## Quick start (manual)

On the builder:

    nix-grpc-daemon --listen 0.0.0.0:50051

On the client, use `nix-with-plugin` (or add
`plugin-files = /path/to/lib/nix/plugins` to `nix.conf`) and use it like
any other store URI:

    nix store info --store 'grpc://builder:50051?insecure=1'
    nix build nixpkgs#hello --store 'grpc://builder:50051?insecure=1'
    nix copy --to 'grpc://builder:50051?insecure=1' ./result

The daemon proxies to the local `nix-daemon` socket, so gRPC clients get
whatever store privileges the uid running `nix-grpc-daemon` has.

## TLS and mTLS

Server:

    nix-grpc-daemon --listen 0.0.0.0:50051 \
        --tls-cert server.pem --tls-key server.key \
        --client-ca ca.pem              # optional: require client certs

Client:

    nix build --store \
      'grpc://builder:50051?ca-cert=ca.pem&client-cert=me.pem&client-key=me.key' ...

Without `--client-ca` any TLS client can connect. With it, only clients
presenting a certificate signed by that CA are accepted.

## Trust model

gRPC clients act as the `nix-grpc-daemon` user, which is not trusted by
default. That is enough for `nix build --store 'grpc://…'`, `nix copy`,
path queries and GC: sources and derivations are content-addressed, signed
cache paths are accepted, and the server builds everything itself.

This makes an untrusting server usable as a builder without any special
setup:

    nix build nixpkgs#hello --store 'grpc://builder:50051' --eval-store auto

Evaluation runs locally (`--eval-store auto` keeps the eval artifacts in
the local store instead of round-tripping them to the server), the
derivation closure is imported — sources and `.drv` files are
content-addressed, so they pass signature checks — and all builds happen
server-side. Nothing unsigned crosses the trust boundary, so
`trustClients` can stay off.

Using the server as a remote builder (`builders = grpc://…`) is different:
there the *client* schedules builds and uploads input paths it built
locally, which are unsigned — something only trusted users may do. Set
`services.nix-grpc-daemon.trustClients = true` for that. Every
authenticated client then has trusted-user privileges, so require client
certs (`tls.clientCaFile`).

## Access control

With mTLS, `--allow 'cn-pattern=role'` maps client certificate CNs to
roles via glob patterns. The first match wins and unmatched clients are
denied. Without any rules every authenticated client keeps full access.

    nix-grpc-daemon ... --client-ca ca.pem \
        --allow 'ci-*=trusted' \
        --allow 'cache-mirror=read-only' \
        --allow '*=write' \
        --allow-anonymous read-only    # optional: cert-less clients

  * `read-only` — path queries and NAR downloads (`nix copy --from`)
  * `write` — additionally imports (signature checking is enforced
    regardless of `--no-check-sigs`) and server-side builds
    (`nix build --store 'grpc://…'`)
  * `trusted` — everything, including the raw worker-protocol tunnel
    (GC, `nix store add`, repair) and unsigned imports (still subject to
    the nix-daemon's trust in the proxy user, see above)

`--allow-anonymous ROLE` relaxes the client-certificate requirement:
cert-less clients connect with that role (e.g. a public read-only
cache), certificate holders keep their `--allow` roles. Naming policies
pair well with a CA like [step-ca](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/),
where provisioners constrain which CNs each token may request.

`--trusted-proxy CN-PATTERN` is for a TLS-terminating L7 balancer (envoy)
in front of the daemon. A peer presenting a certificate whose CN matches is
a proxy: the daemon takes the client's identity from the
`x-forwarded-client-cert` header it sets (`Subject` CN, evaluated against
`--allow`) or a forwarded bearer token, and treats the request as anonymous
if neither is present. From any other peer the header is ignored. The
proxy must overwrite the header (envoy `forward_client_cert_details:
SANITIZE_SET`) and authenticate to the daemon with its own client cert.

NixOS:

    services.nix-grpc-daemon.accessRules = [
      { cn = "ci-*"; role = "trusted"; }
      { cn = "*"; role = "read-only"; }
    ];
    services.nix-grpc-daemon.anonymousRole = "read-only"; # optional

Role needed per use case:

| Use case                                         | Role        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Substituter, `nix copy --from`                   | `read-only` |
| `nix copy --to` (signed paths)                   | `write`     |
| `nix build --store 'grpc://…' --eval-store auto` | `write`     |
| Remote builder (`nix.buildMachines`)             | `trusted`   |
| GC, `--repair`, `nix store add`                  | `trusted`   |

Builds are submitted through a dedicated RPC and run entirely
server-side, so the `write` role suffices. Only operations that tunnel
the raw worker protocol need `trusted`, and repair builds are treated
like the rest of the repair surface.

For host-based access, pair this with a CA that issues certs with the
host's domain name in the CN, e.g. a
[step-ca](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/) ACME provisioner with
`forceCN = true`: each host obtains its certificate via ordinary ACME
(`security.acme`) and an `accessRules` glob like `*.example.com =
read-only` grants it substituter access. See
[`tests/acme-substituter-test.nix`](tests/acme-substituter-test.nix)
for a complete, tested NixOS setup (built as the `acme-vm` check).

### OIDC bearer tokens

Instead of (or next to) client certificates the daemon accepts
`authorization: Bearer <jwt>` and maps token claims to the same roles.
`--oidc-config FILE` takes the JSON schema of
[niks3](https://github.com/Mic92/niks3)'s `--oidc-config`, so one file
can serve the cache and the daemon. Scopes map to roles: `read` →
`read-only`, `write` → `write`, `admin` → `trusted`.

    {
      "providers": {
        "github": {
          "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
          "audience": "grpc://cache.example.com",
          "rules": [
            { "bound_subject": ["repo:myorg/*"], "scopes": ["write"] },
            { "bound_claims": { "ref": ["refs/heads/main"] }, "scopes": ["admin"] }
          ]
        },
        "k8s": {
          "audience": "grpc://cache.example.com",
          "ca_file": "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt",
          "bearer_token_file": "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token",
          "bound_claims": { "kubernetes.io.namespace": ["ci"] }
        }
      }
    }

Without `issuer`, it is taken from `bearer_token_file` (Kubernetes
workload identity). `jwks_url` skips discovery. Signing keys are
fetched on first use and cached for an hour, so the daemon starts while
the issuer is down and refuses tokens until it comes back. A presented
client certificate takes precedence over a token. A verified token that
matches no rule is denied, it does not fall back to `--allow-anonymous`.
In logs and metrics the caller shows as `oidc:<provider>:<sub>`.

Clients pass the token with the `token-file` URI parameter or
`$NIX_GRPC_TOKEN_FILE` (default: `token` next to the default
`client-cert`). The file is re-read for every call, so rotating it in
place works. TLS is required.

NixOS: `services.nix-grpc-daemon.oidc = { providers.github = { … }; };`

## Scaling out

One daemon is a farm of one: it schedules builds onto itself. More nodes
behind a balancer, one of them the scheduler, with deduplicated builds and
S3 outputs: see [docs/farm.md](docs/farm.md) for NixOS and
[docs/kubernetes.md](docs/kubernetes.md) for the Helm chart.

## Remote builder

    nix.buildMachines = [{
      hostName = "grpc://builder:50051";
      protocol = null;
      systems = [ "x86_64-linux" "aarch64-linux" ];
      maxJobs = 64;
    }];

TLS uses the system CA bundle and the client key pair from
`/run/nix-grpc-store` or `/var/lib/nix-grpc-store` by default (see below).

With access control enabled, remote builders need the `trusted` role.
The builder protocol imports unsigned outputs built on the client,
which also requires `trustClients` (see above).

## URI parameters

  * `insecure` — plaintext, no TLS (testing only)
  * `ca-cert` — PEM CA to verify the server. Defaults to `$NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE`,
    `$SSL_CERT_FILE` or the system CA bundle
  * `client-cert`, `client-key` — PEM pair to present for mTLS. Default to
    `$NIX_GRPC_CLIENT_CERT`/`$NIX_GRPC_CLIENT_KEY`, then `client.crt`/`client.key`
    in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/nix-grpc-store`, then `/run/nix-grpc-store`, then
    `/var/lib/nix-grpc-store` (unreadable candidates are skipped, and none
    is looked up when `token-file` is given)
  * `token-file` — OIDC bearer token, re-read per call. Defaults to
    `$NIX_GRPC_TOKEN_FILE`, then `token` in the directories above
  * `connect-timeout` (default 30) — seconds the first call keeps retrying
    "connection refused" and similar.
  * `restart-grace` (default 120) — once the server has answered, seconds
    to ride out a worker or scheduler restart, and to wait while the
    scheduler says no worker can take a build.
  * `reschedule-retries` (default 8) — how often a derivation whose
    assigned worker went away is handed back to the scheduler.
  * `max-builds` (default 64) — concurrent `BuildDerivation` streams.
  * `system` — send `x-nix-system` on every call, not just builds, so a
    balancer routes input uploads and substitution to a worker of that
    system. Use one `nix.buildMachines` entry per system.
  * `debug` — print which CA bundle and client certificate were loaded and
    turn on gRPC's TCP/TLS handshake tracing on stderr. `NIX_GRPC_DEBUG=1`
    does the same and also reaches the build hook.

## Server flags

  * `--listen ADDR` — default `0.0.0.0:50051`
  * `--proxy-socket PATH` — nix-daemon socket, default `/nix/var/nix/daemon-socket/socket`
  * `--tls-cert`, `--tls-key`, `--client-ca` — see above
  * `--allow 'cn-pattern=role'`, `--allow-anonymous ROLE`, `--trusted-proxy CN-PATTERN` — see access control
  * `--oidc-config FILE` — accept OIDC bearer tokens, see access control
  * `--metrics-listen ADDR` — serve Prometheus metrics, disabled if unset
  * `--worker-name NAME` — name in build-log prefixes and `nix_grpc_build_info`, default hostname
  * `--role builder,scheduler`, `--scheduler ADDR`, `--scheduler-token-file FILE`, `--advertise IP:PORT`, `--max-jobs N`, `--min-free SIZE` — see [docs/farm.md](docs/farm.md). The defaults make a single node schedule onto itself
  * `--niks3 URL [--niks3-token-file FILE] [--niks3-client-cert FILE --niks3-client-key FILE] [--niks3-push CMD]` — publish build outputs and uploads to a niks3 cache; authenticate with a bearer token, a client certificate (defaults to `--tls-cert/--tls-key`), or both
  * `--log-level info|debug` — access log verbosity, default `info`

## Monitoring

All gRPC clients act as the same local user, so activity is attributed to the
client certificate CN (`cn=-` without mTLS). Have your CA put a user name in
the CN and logs and metrics are per user.

### Access log

The daemon writes one logfmt line per RPC to stderr (journald):

    ts=2025-01-15T12:03:41Z level=info event=rpc method=Connect cn=alice peer=ipv4:10.0.0.5:53211 duration_s=1832 bytes_in=52341 bytes_out=812345678

| event | logged for | extra fields |
|---|---|---|
| `rpc` | tunnel sessions, transfers, builds | duration, then per method: bytes in/out, path count, NAR bytes, drv |
| `rpc_start`, path queries | only at `--log-level debug` | |

Every line carries the client certificate CN and the peer address, so one
user's activity is a grep away:

    journalctl -u nix-grpc-daemon | grep cn=alice

### Prometheus metrics

With `--metrics-listen 127.0.0.1:9464` (NixOS:
`services.nix-grpc-daemon.metricsListen`) the daemon serves `/metrics`:

| metric | labels | counts |
|---|---|---|
| `nix_grpc_rpcs_total` | method, cn | RPCs handled |
| `nix_grpc_tunnel_bytes_total` | direction, cn | uncompressed tunnel bytes |
| `nix_grpc_nar_bytes_total` | direction, cn | uncompressed NAR bytes imported/exported |
| `nix_grpc_build_info` | version, worker, system, features | constant 1, for joins and version skew |
| `nix_grpc_sched` | kind = queued, workers, clients, leader | scheduler state |
| `nix_grpc_sched_system` | system, features, kind = queued, unplaceable, running, slots, free | queue (by required features) and capacity (by offered features), for autoscaling |
| `nix_grpc_events_total` | kind | assigned, cached, attached, expect_no_show, unexpected_build, … |
| `nix_grpc_build_failures_total` | reason | failed builds, by Nix failure status: PermanentFailure, TimedOut, TransientFailure, … |

Only CA-issued CNs appear as labels, so cardinality stays bounded.

## Tests

    nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.vm -L

End-to-end NixOS VM test plus a 256 MiB throughput benchmark against the unix
socket and `perf` counters. See `src/pump.hh` for design notes on chunk
coalescing and flushable zstd.

    nix build .#bench-latency -L

VM benchmark measuring `nix copy` of 200 small paths at an emulated 50 ms
RTT. `scripts/bench-transports.py` and `scripts/bench-builds.py`
benchmark real hosts and `scripts/bench-plot.py` renders the charts
above.
